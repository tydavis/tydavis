# Hello, nerds

I write code, occasionally. I spend more time managing projects, programs,
supporting people and their careers. I believe people are the solution to (and
cause of) most problems in our world.

I GM infrequent D&D games. I lurk on Twitter and HackerNews. You may find me in
the mountains hiking, or in my Jeep on the way to/from.

Pronouns: he/him
